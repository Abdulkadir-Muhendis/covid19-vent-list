# covid19-vent-list
A list projects to make emergency ventilators in response to COVID-19, focusing on free-libre open source.

PLEASE make pull requests or submit issues too add any project missing from this list.  The comments are entirely my own (possibly not well-informed) opinions and are meant to be helpful to those looking for quick information, not to disparage any project.

A list of valuabe resources exists below this list.

# Projects

## Blower/Fan based

[Low-Cost Open Source Ventilator](https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator)

Probably best state of buildability at the the time of this writing.

['Pandemic ventilator' could offer solution in potential 'worst case' coronavirus scenario](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/pandemic-ventilator-coronvirus-hospitals-1.5493830)

A well-developed device reported on by Canadian Broadcasting Company. Creator (Mr. John Strupat) may open source design soon. Note that this has a test-lung as part of the system, a very simple and important feature reproducible elsewhere even without this design. Nature of internale design not visible

## Ambubag based

[Open Source Ventilator - OpenLung BVM Ventilator](https://gitlab.com/TrevorSmale/OSV-OpenLung)

Fully open (GPL). Aims to adopt bag valve masks, based on designs (not open) from Rice and MIT. Author (Trevor Smale) responded to email.

[Rice OEDK Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DRXnVkJOlDCmvTzh-DgWDxeLSrZTiBYyH0ypzv8tNA/edit?usp=sharing)

A high-quality student project, input into Open Lung, possible not actionable.

[Jeff Ebin's Prototpye](https://www.facebook.com/groups/670932227050506?view=permalink&id=675336579943404&scmts=scwspsdd&extid=MnVADGiqBuaYx9KD)

Functioning Abmu-bag based model. Not obviously open with no published design, but possibly easy to copy.

[The Pandemic Ventilator](https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Pandemic-Ventilator/)

From 2007. Uses a relatively old and expensive programmable logic controller, but a great starting place. Possibly well tested.

[Hackaday Rex Ventilator V1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFnB-vOWQmU)

An update of the previous project. No known open-source repo at present.

[Simple device from www.POMO.cl](https://www.facebook.com/groups/670932227050506/permalink/675264606617268/?app=fbl)

Nice video, possibly nice control, no obvious link to replicatable design documents.

[MIT Low Cost Ventilator](https://github.com/RuairiSpain/openVentilator)

Some work from MIT?  Have not had time to evaluate.

[Pandemic Ventilator Project](https://panvent.blogspot.com/2008/02/test-of-pandemic-ventilator-with.html)

Working prototype, currently active.

[Dr. Mujeeb ur Rahman design ](http://www.technologyreview.pk/pakistani-engineer-braves-tragedy-to-develop-low-cost-ventilator/)

Unclear if the design is published. Good data collection.

[Protofy Team OxyGEN]https://oxygen.protofy.xyz/)

Yet another Ambubag based design, using a plywood cam. Well-documented and buildable.

## Cuirass/Negative Pressure/Iron Lung base

[Cuirass Ventilator the DIY way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvrUQCMa3a8&feature=youtu.be)

A valuable and educational video, open in spirit. (Note: this does not provide positive pressure, or the direct inclusion of oxygen. This would be a valuable part of a spectrum of solutions in a catastrophic situation.)

[The Pandemic Ventilator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dz7eMgXowFBtBA_0PKzfAXweHnNMbGlIAXPshCbI2Vk/edit?usp=sharing)

An impressive document, other status unknown at time of writing.

## Test Equipment/Projects

[Ventilator Test Fixture](https://github.com/PubInv/ventilator-test-lung-analyzer)

My own attempt to build a test apparatus that meaasures clinical suitability as well as reliability.  More test projects are needed!

This important document suggests that in the case of a severe epidemic, the US will bottleneck on have enough people trained on ventilators (but also not have enough ventilators, or beds.)

[Virus Simulator](https://github.com/SilverLinings89/VirusSimulator)

A useful resource for programmers as a model; data seems insufficient to accurately model COVID-19 at present although it has a preset for it.
